# membership-plan
This project is a clone of the common membership plan amongst plenty of websites promoting a product.

The website is completely responsive and uses purely html and css. I built this project while keeping in mind good programminig practises such as BEM(Block, Element, Modifier) methodology, css variables, well structured css and html code and more.
